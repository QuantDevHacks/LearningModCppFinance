## Update
Zip files containing the Boost header files, the Eigen library, and the reference implementations of mdspan, submdspan, stdBLAS, and mdarray have been uploaded in respective folders in the repository.  The Boost version is 1.78.0, and the code will compile and run with this version, but there is a later version available on Boost.org.  You can also get the Eigen library from their website https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page if you wish, which may contain subsequent updates.  Finally, mdspan, stdBLAS et al are in the stdBLAS folder.  This will work with the sample code in the book, but there may also be update in the Kokkos GitHub repository cited in the book.  These are included here for convenience, but if you want the more recent versions, please refer to the respective websites/repositories.
